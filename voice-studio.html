                        <h2>Welcome to My Voice Studio</h2>
                        <p>I offer private voice instruction for students of all levels, from beginners to advanced performers. With over a decade of teaching experience and ongoing doctoral studies in vocal performance, I bring both expertise and passion to each lesson.</p>

                            <h3>Teaching Philosophy and Method</h3>
                            <p>My teaching philosophy is grounded in the belief that every voice is unique and deserves to be nurtured with care, patience, and curiosity. I strive to create a supportive environment where singers can build confidence, develop healthy technique, and discover joy in expressive music-making. I see voice teaching not only as a technical process but also as a holistic journey that cultivates body awareness, emotional connection, and artistic growth.</p>
                            
                            <p>My method focuses on the following:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Breath and Body Awareness:</strong> Establishing relaxed but active posture, efficient breath support, and body-mind connection through simple alignment and breath exercises.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tone and Resonance:</strong> Encouraging a free, balanced tone through vocal exercises that promote openness and ease, helping students find resonance without strain.</li>
                                <li><strong>Range Development and Registration:</strong> Helping students understand and navigate vocal registers (chest, head, mix) through gentle vocalises, while making sure they sing in a comfortable, age-appropriate range.</li>
                                <li><strong>Text and Expression:</strong> Encouraging connection to the text through diction work, phrasing, and storytelling. Even early in development, I believe expressive communication builds confidence and connection.</li>
                                <li><strong>Vocal Health and Repertoire Choices:</strong> I emphasize sustainable technique and choose repertoire that supports vocal growth—songs that stretch ability but don't overburden the voice.</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <p>I adjust my approach based on each student's voice type, musical background, and learning style. My goal is to help them sing with freedom, authenticity, and growing independence, while building a strong technical foundation and expressive artistry.</p>
