                        <p>Xin Zhou is a lyrical soprano, voice teacher and currently pursuing the Doctor of Musical Arts in Vocal Performance and Literature at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign. She serves as a Graduate Teaching Assistant in the Voice Area, where she teaches applied voice lessons, leads studio classes, and works closely with undergraduate singers as they develop both their technique and artistic identity.</p>

                        <p>Originally from China, Xin completed her bachelor's and master's degrees at Beijing Normal University before continuing her training in the United States. Alongside her academic studies, she has taught voice in a wide range of settings—including middle and high schools, university courses, and private studios—experiences that have shaped her belief in flexible, student-centered teaching. She has maintained an active private studio since 2015, guiding students toward auditions, performances, and long-term vocal growth.</p>

                        <p>As a performer, Xin appears regularly in opera, recital, and ensemble settings. Her recent operatic roles include Contessa in <em>Le Nozze di Figaro</em> and Donna Elvira in <em>Don Giovanni</em>, as well as scenes from <em>Der Rosenkavalier</em> and <em>Roméo et Juliette</em>. At UIUC, she has been featured as both soprano and alto soloist in works by Bach, Haydn, Fauré, Buxtehude, and contemporary composers, and she enjoys collaborating in choral and orchestral projects that span a wide range of styles and traditions.</p>

                        <p>Xin's work has been recognized with a number of awards and honors. She was recently named a finalist for the Krannert Debut Artist Award 2025 and the UIUC Concerto Competition 2025, and has received 3rd place at the NATS Central Region auditions and several international vocal competitions. Throughout her studies, she has also been supported by competitive scholarships that reflect her commitment to both performance and scholarship.</p>

                        <p>Her doctoral research focuses on the art songs of Joseph Marx, with the aim of creating a performer-teacher guide that connects musical analysis with practical vocal application.</p>
